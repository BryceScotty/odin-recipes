        <h2>Let's Dive In</h2>
        <p>At the ripe age of 19, just a few days ago, I cooked my <strong>very first egg</strong> 
            (no joke). Too proud of this feat i am not, but tis' a feat nonetheless.
            It was scrambled, of course, so I didn't need to fret about the precision of cooking it
            to a certain rarity <em>(to take even further pride away from my trivial accomplishment)</em>; but
            that's beside the fact. Today, I am going to show you how to make 3 of my most
            <strong>world renown dishes</strong> which have never been perfectly replicated, but closely duplicated. 
            Prestigious, world-class chefs - including Gordan - and many others have attempted... futilely.
