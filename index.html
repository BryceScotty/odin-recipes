        <h2>Let's Dive In</h2>
        <p>At the ripe age of 19, just a few days ago, I cooked my very first egg 
            (no joke). Too proud of this feat i am not, but tis' a feat nonetheless.
            It was scrambled, of course, so I didn't need to fret about precisely cooking it
            to a certain rarity - to take further pride away from my trivial accomplishment; but,
            that's beside the fact. Today, I am going to show you how to make 3 of my 
            world renown dishes which have been closely replicated by a handful of
             prestigious, world-class chefs, including Gordan, but never truly perfected.
        </p>
